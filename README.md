# upland.me-api
A project to find all calls for the upland.me API

I want to write an interface for the upland.me API in Python. Maybe I'll use that to write some scripts, that will do some boring work for me.

I've found an hardcoded access token in the js-files of the game: `pk.eyJ1IjoidXBsYW5kbWUiLCJhIjoiY2pydGF1OWttMHF2azN6bTl0MWRxNXp0cyJ9.b8JmL-_Beo4J3qZoB97wOw`
